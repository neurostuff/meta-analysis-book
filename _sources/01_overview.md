# Overview

This book will walk you through conceptualizing your own meta-analysis to interpreting the results
using existing standards and reproducible tools.

## Conceptualizing your meta-analysis

This is the step that will require the most thought and planning. You will need to immerse
yourself in the literature to identify the topic of your meta-analysis, what question does the
meta-analysis answer. You will need to decide whether you are using a coordinate-based or
image-based meta-analysis, and what method you will use to run your meta-analysis.

## Finding and preparing your data

Once you have a topic for your meta-analysis, you will need to define search criteria to find
studies that are relevant to your meta-analysis.

## Selecting your meta-analysis method

There are several methods for running either coordinate-based or image-based meta-analyses.
Which method you can use is dependent on the assumptions you would like to make about your data
and the availablity of certain data.

## Decision tree
Do I have coordinates or images?

### Coordinate-based meta-analysis
There is not a lot of comparison between ALE and MKDA,
so choosing either or both for your meta-analysis may be a good idea
to test if there is consensus between the two methods.


### Image-based meta-analysis
