# PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

To begin our journey into the world of neuroimaging meta-analyses, we will first discuss the importance of reporting and reproducibility in scientific research. We will then introduce the PRISMA guidelines, which are a set of guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.



## What is PRISMA?

PRISMA is a set of guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The guidelines are intended to help authors and readers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to understand the methods used in a given study, and to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The PRISMA guidelines are intended to be a minimum standard for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The PRISMA statement is a 27-item checklist that authors can use to ensure that their manuscript includes all of the necessary information for a reader to understand the methods used in a given study. The PRISMA statement is available at <https://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Default.aspx>.


## Create your question

Sadly, we are not able to automate this stage of the process yet (but the advent of large language models and projects
like NeuroLang may make this process more machine friendly in the future). However, we can provide some guidance on how to formulate your question.
It is critical your question is well defined and specific. If you are interested in the broad topic of emotion for example, there are several important questions to ask yourself:

1. What is the specific emotion or set of emotions you are interested in?
2. How do you define those specific emotions?
3. How are those emotions elicited in different psychological paradigms?
4. Are you interested in a particular population or age group?
5. Could you define sub-analyses based on the above questions? (for example, you may be interested in the effects of emotion on a specific cognitive task in a specific age group)

The following paper "Ten Simple rules for neuroimaging meta-analyses" provides a good overview of the process of formulating a question and the pitfalls to avoid. The paper is available at <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29180258/>.



## Determine your eligibility criteria

Once you've constructed a specific and focused research question,
you will already have begun thinking about inclusion and exclusion criteria for your meta-analysis.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of criteria that you may want to consider:
1. neuroimaging modalities (e.g. fMRI, PET, structural etc.)
2. populations (e.g., children, patients with or without medications or comordities, older adults, etc.)
3. task paradigms (e.g., stroop, flanker, Go/No-Go, etc.)
4. between or within subject designs 


## Cultivate your search strategy

With a precise question and a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, you are now ready to begin constructing your search strategy.
If you 
There are several popular databases that you can use to search for relevant studies such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.
Additionally, our own NeuroStore database is a great resource for finding relevant studies.
NeuroStore combines studies extracted from NeuroSynth, NeuroQuery, and NeuroVault with tags to get a unqiue search experience for neuroimaging meta-analyses.
A nice feature of studies searched on NeuroStore
is that the coordinates and images are pre-extracted and ready to use in your meta-analysis.
There will be some error in the extraction process, so it is important to check the coordinates, but editing is much easier than
inserting all of the coordinates manually.
