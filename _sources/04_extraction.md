# Data extraction/collection from studies

Now that you have a curated list of studies you want to analyze, you will need to extract the coordinates and other pertinant information from those studies.
This is another time consuming process.
Neurosynth-Compose contains coordinates from studies that were automatically extracted, but this process
is not perfect and you should check the coordinates for accuracy.
In addition to coordinates, you may want to keep track of other information about the study such as
sample size, the specific task used, the type of stimuli, etc.
We differentiate between facts about the study and more opinionated information about the study.
The factual information is stored as meta-data about the study and you will need to own the study to
change this information.
The opinionated information is stored as annotations and you can add annotations to any study. 
Annotations could represent inclusion crtieria, quality ratings, or any specific categorization you
want to make about the study that is specific to your meta-analysis.
