# NeuroSynth Compose Glossary

## Project

A project is analogous to neuroimaging meta-analysis paper. A project contains the curation of the studies, the specifications of the meta-analyses, as well as the results of the meta-analyses.
An individual should be able to publish a paper based on a project.

## Meta-Analysis

A meta-analysis is comprised of three parts:

1. A collection of analyses from multiple studies that are combined to produce results.
2. A specification of method(s) used to combine the analyses.
3. The statistical results after running the method(s) on the analyses.

## StudySet

A StudySet is a collection of studies. You can create a StudySet by uploading studies or by searching for studies in the NeuroSynth-Compose platform.


## Study

A study is a single neuroimaging study. A study could be published in a journal, a preprint, or a conference proceeding, or not be published at all.
A study is composed of one or more Analyses.

## Analysis

An analysis is a single neuroimaging analysis within a study.
An analysis contains a contrast of conditions and associated results in the form of coordinates and/or statistical maps.
Analyses are the unit of analysis in NeuroSynth-Compose.
Many meta-analyses only include one analysis from each study, but it is possible to include multiple analyses from a single study, so the selection of what to include in the meta-analysis is decided at the analysis level.
