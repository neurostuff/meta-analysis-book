# Curation

While creating your precise question, thinking about your inclusion and exclusion criteria, and deriving your search strategy is intellectually challenging, the curation stage of the process is the most time consuming.
Here is where you will need to be patient and diligent while reading through the studies you've found and identifying which studies are eligible for inclusion in your meta-analysis.
Using a common PRISMA workflow, NeuroSynth Compose provides a simple interface for curating studies with four columns:
- Identification
- Screening
- Eligibility
- Included

This is how we will categorize the studies we've found in our search, but you can use any categorization scheme that is more appropriate for your research question.
This is an opinionated guide, not a manual, so feel free to adapt the process to your needs.


With the studies you've aggregated from your search, you are ready to begin curating the studies to determine which studies are eligible for inclusion in your meta-analysis.

If you've performed searches on multiple databases
(and sometimes even on a single database), you will likely find duplicate studies.
Don't fret, this is a common problem.
We will need to mark duplicate studies, however.
Within NeuroSynth Compose you can mark duplicate studies by clicking the "Mark as duplicate" button when you are uploading studies.
