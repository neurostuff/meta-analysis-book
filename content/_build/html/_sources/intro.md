Welcome!
 
The goal of this course is to introduce the rationale and basic concepts of neuroimaging meta-analysis, paired with a detailed tutorial using the Neurosynth Compose platform.
This book has two main sections: a set of [video lectures](lectures.md), and an [interactive tutorial](tutorials.md) , where you will follow Dr. Anna Lytical on her journey to run a meta-analysis.

This was original taught as a half day course. Feel free to browse at your leisure, or complete the whole course in 2-3 hours. 


```{note}
After following this tutorial visit the [official documentation](https://neurostuff.github.io/compose-docs/) for up to date documentation on the Neurosynth Compose platform.

- Know the landscape of neuroimaging meta-analysis methods
- Identify the strengths and weakness of different meta-analysis methods
- Choose a meta-analysis method that is appropriate for your research question and available data
- Run a meta-analysis using a reproducible workflow and tools on Neurosynth Compose
- Interpret the results of your meta-analysis
