Project
    A project is intended to be the basis of a neuroimaging meta-analysis paper. A project contains the curation of the studies, the specifications of the meta-analyses, as well as the results of the meta-analyses.
    An individual should be able to publish a paper based on a project.

Meta-Analysis
    A meta-analysis is comprised of three parts:
    1. A collection of analyses from multiple studies that are combined to produce results.
    2. A specification of method(s) used to combine the analyses.
    3. The statistical results after running the method(s) on the analyses.

Studyset
    A Studyset is a collection of studies. You can create a Studyset by uploading studies or by searching for studies in the Neurosynth-Compose platform.

Study
    A study is a single neuroimaging study. A study could be published in a journal, a preprint, or a conference proceeding, or not be published at all.
    A study is composed of one or more Analyses.

Analysis
    An analysis is a single neuroimaging analysis within a study.
    An analysis contains a contrast of conditions and associated results in the form of coordinates and/or statistical maps.
    Analyses are the unit of analysis in NeuroSynth-Compose.
    Many meta-analyses only include one analysis from each study, but it is possible to include multiple analyses from a single study, necessitating the selection of what to include in the meta-analysis at the analysis level and not the study level.

Annotation
    An annotation refers to the collection of labels that are associated with analyses.

Note
    the labels that are associated with a specific analysis.
